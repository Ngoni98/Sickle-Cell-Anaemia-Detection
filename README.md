# Sickle-Cell-Anaemia-Detection
Red Blood Corpuscles are the major cellular component of human blood. An RBC is circular in front view and bi-concave in side view. In terms of size, it is 7.5 μm in diameter and 2 μm in thickness.This normal morphology of RBC undergoes specific changes as a consequence of different pathological abnormalities. One of such disease is ‘Sickle Cell Anaemia’ where the RBCs take crescentic ‘sickle’ like shape.In this project image processing is applied to detect the sickle cells in the RBC by detecting the change in the shape of the cells in the microscopic image of RBC.
